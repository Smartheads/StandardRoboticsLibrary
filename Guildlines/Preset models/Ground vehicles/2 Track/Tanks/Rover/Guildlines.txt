1. Introduction
SCSRL is a robotics development framework developed by Smart Crew 2012 Rover Technologies. The framework is designed to provide easy to use functions, which allow complex, but maintainable and expandable robotics development.

2. Definition of an SCSRL rover
An SCRSL rover is a special type of tank, which has sensors capable of keeping track of the rover's real-time position & orientation. The rover may contain other components other than the mandatory ones.

3. Structural requirements of an SCSRL rover
The library only provides functionality for the required components of an object. The structural requirements of an SCSRL rover are the following:
 * All the structural requirements of an SCSRL tank (SEE: Tank Guidelines)

4. Hardware requirements of an SCSRL rover
The hardware requirements of an SCSRL rover are the following:
 * All the hardware requirements of an SCSRL tank
 * An accelerometer
 * A gyroscope
 * A distance measuring tool (i.e. rotary encoders)

5. Software implementation of an SCSRL rover
The SCSRL framework provides a multitude of functions to enable rover-type robots development. There are the following:
 * All the implementations of an SCSRL tank
 * Interrupt based directional monitoring
 * Directional and given distance movement commands
