1. Intoduction
SCSRL is a robotics development framework developed by Smart Crew 2012 Rover Technologies. The framework is designed to provide easy to use functions, which allow complex, but maintainable and expandable robotics development.

2. Definition of an SCSRL tank
An SCSRL tank is a ground vehicle, which has 2 tracks, both on seperate drive shafts. The tank may or might not have other hardware objects, like sensors / other servos.

3. Structural requirments of a SCSRL tank
The library only provides functionality for the required components of an object. The structural requirments of an SCSRL tank are the following:
 * Rectangular footprint
 * Circular diameter drive shafts

4. Hardware requirments of an SCRSL tank
The hardware requirments of an SCRSL tank are the following:
 * Arduino microcontroller (or Arduino compatible)
 * H-bridge 2 DC motor controller
 * 2 DC motors (driving the tracks)
