1. Introduction
SCSRL is a robotics development framework developed by Smart Crew 2012 Rover Technologies. The framework is designed to provide easy to use functions, which allow complex, but maintainable and expandable robotics development.

2. Definition of an SCSRL tank
An SCSRL tank is a ground vehicle, which has 2 tracks, both on separate drive shafts. The tank may or might not have other hardware objects, like sensors / other servos.

3. Structural requirements of a SCSRL tank
The library only provides functionality for the required components of an object. The structural requirements of an SCSRL tank are the following:
 * Rectangular footprint
 * 2 separate drive shafts

4. Hardware requirements of an SCRSL tank
The hardware requirements of an SCRSL tank are the following:
 * Arduino microcontroller (or Arduino compatible)
 * H-bridge 2 DC motor controller
 * 2 DC motors (driving the tracks)

5. Software implementation of an SCSRL tank
The SCSRL framework provides a multitude of functions to enable tank-type robots development. There are the following:
 * Motor control:
  * Individual motor control
  * Synchronized motor control
